Welcome to the **AI Resume Modifier** project! This project leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to modify existing resumes and make them more **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)-friendly**. 

An ATS is a software tool used by many employers to filter job applications based on keywords and formatting. Resumes that are not ATS-friendly often get rejected even if they have the right experience and qualifications.

In this project, we aim to solve that problem by using AI to analyze, modify, and optimize resumes for ATS compatibility, increasing the chances of candidates passing the initial application screening process.

    The **AI Resume Modifier** is designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for ATS. 
    Many job seekers face the challenge of having their resumes rejected by ATS, even if they are qualified for the role. ATS often rejects resumes based on:

    - Poor formatting.
    - Lack of important keywords (such as job-specific terms).
    - Misalignment with job descriptions.

    This project aims to automate the process of converting existing resumes into ATS-friendly versions. The AI will analyze the original resume, identify areas for improvement, and suggest changes to make the resume more likely to pass ATS screening.
