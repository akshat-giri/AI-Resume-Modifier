Given a LaTeX-formatted resume and a job description, analyze both documents to identify missing keywords and skills that align with the job requirements. Adapt the resume by seamlessly integrating these missing elements into relevant sections while preserving the original structure and formatting.

Resume Adaptation:

Work Experience:
Review each work experience entry and identify opportunities to incorporate keywords and quantifiable achievements.
Rephrase job responsibilities and accomplishments to highlight skills and experiences relevant to the job description.
Add bullet points or paragraphs to emphasize specific projects or responsibilities that align with the target position.
Skills and Technologies:
Add or modify skills sections to include any missing keywords or technologies identified in the job description.
Organize skills into logical categories (e.g., programming languages, data analysis tools, soft skills) for better readability.
Education and Certifications:
Highlight relevant coursework, projects, or certifications that demonstrate proficiency in the required skills.
Add any missing certifications or licenses that could enhance the applicant's profile.
ATS Optimization:

Formatting and Structure:
Maintain the original LaTeX structure and formatting to ensure consistency.
Avoid using unconventional LaTeX commands or symbols that may interfere with ATS parsing.

Use natural language and avoid keyword stuffing.
Output:
A LaTeX-formatted resume with the following improvements:

Enhanced keyword density: Increased the frequency of relevant keywords and phrases.
Improved skill alignment: Added or emphasized skills that match the job requirements.
Quantifiable achievements: Included specific examples of accomplishments to demonstrate impact.

Task: Analyze a LaTeX resume against a specific job description.

Input:

LaTeX Resume: A LaTeX file containing the applicant's resume.
Job Description: A text document outlining the job requirements, including specific keywords, skills, and experiences.
Output:

ATS Score: A numerical score from 0 to 100, indicating the applicant's fit for the job.
Keyword Match: A list of keywords from the job description that were found or missing in the resume.
Section Analysis: A breakdown of how well the resume sections (Work Experience, Skills, Education, Certifications) align with the job requirements.
Formatting Evaluation: A comment on the LaTeX formatting's suitability for ATS parsing.
Scoring Criteria:

Exact Keyword Match (50%):
Award points for each exact keyword match from the job description found in the resume.
Deduct points for each missing keyword, especially if it's a core requirement.
Relevance of Experience and Sections (20%):
Award points for the presence of essential sections (Work Experience, Skills, Education, Certifications).
Deduct points for missing sections or irrelevant experience.
Formatting and ATS Compatibility (10%):
Award points for clear, simple formatting with headings, bullet points, and minimal complexity.
Deduct points for complex formatting that might hinder parsing.
Alignment with Job Requirements (20%):
Award points for direct matches between the applicant's experience and skills and the specific job requirements.
Example Input:

LaTeX Resume: A LaTeX file containing the applicant's CV with sections for Experience, Skills, Education, and Certifications.
Job Description: A text document specifying requirements for a Python developer, including keywords like "Python," "Pandas," "Machine Learning," and "SQL."
Example Output:

ATS Score: 75

Keyword Match:

Found: Python, Pandas
Missing: Machine Learning, SQL
Section Analysis:

Work Experience: Relevant experience in data analysis.
Skills: Python, Pandas, and some relevant soft skills.
Education: Relevant degree in Computer Science.
Certifications: No relevant certifications.
Formatting Evaluation:

Clear and simple formatting, suitable for ATS parsing.
Explanation:
The applicant's resume has a strong match for the core skills of Python and Pandas. However, the lack of Machine Learning and SQL experience, which are crucial for the job, significantly impacts the score. The formatting is clear and ATS-friendly, contributing positively to the overall score.
